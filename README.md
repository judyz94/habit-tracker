# Habit Tracker

[Leer en espa√±ol](./README.es.md)

This project is a habit tracker and system builder inspired by the ideas of James Clear‚Äôs Atomic Habits.
Instead of focusing only on goals, it helps you design identity-based systems ‚Äî daily actions that make consistency natural and sustainable.

## How It Works
The app allows users to:

üìã **Create, edit, and delete Goals and Habits:**

Organize your objectives and the daily actions that help you achieve them, both weekly and monthly.

üìÖ **Use an interactive Habit Tracker:**

Log your progress day by day, add notes and reminders, and visually track your consistency over the week.

üí≠ **View affirmations and motivational quotes:**

Stay inspired with positive phrases that support your mindset and reinforce your process.

üéØ **Review your weekly and monthly goals at a glance:**

Quickly recall what you‚Äôre working toward and stay focused on what truly matters.

üèÜ **Associate rewards with your habits:**

Celebrate your progress and strengthen the habit loop with meaningful incentives.

> ‚ÄúYou do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.‚Äù ‚Äî James Clear

## Authentication & API Overview

This project provides a secure RESTful API built with Laravel Sanctum.  
Users can register, log in, and manage their personal goals, habits, and affirmations through authenticated routes.


### Authentication Flow

The authentication system uses **Laravel Sanctum** tokens.  
Users must first register or log in to obtain an **API token**, which must be included in subsequent requests via the `Authorization` header.

#### Headers Example
```http
Authorization: Bearer your_api_token_here
Accept: application/json
```

### Authentication API
